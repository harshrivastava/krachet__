TechBlitz Hackathon - KRONOS'25
Hackathon Project


TEAM: KAME_HAME_HACK

We have tried to create an AI Assistant desktop tool which is really helpful in solving Automation, Real Time Queries, Informative Chatting, Image Generation, etc. by the mean of automatic voice recognition and voice answering. 

We had hopes to add a fine UI to this and able toicreate a fine working Frontend for this project, but we're not able to create GUI(we were using pyqt5) completely and it was showing errors that we were not able torsolve during coding hours in hackathon.

We will complete this project as soon as possible somehow by learning required knowledge and fixing currently errors. 
We also want to upgrade this project to able to use further cool new features which we were not able to add.

Thanks for checking this out.
